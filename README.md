# Install-script

 - Run the script with "setup_utility.sh" in the root directory of the repository.
 - The menu items will be automatically generated from the "subscripts"
   folder
 - Scripts and folders will appear in the menu as items or
   folders.

   
   You can easily add new functionality by putting new scripts into the
   subscripts folder. See examples of menus in the "examples_whiptail"
   folder.
